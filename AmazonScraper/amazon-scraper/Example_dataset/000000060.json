  "description": "The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G phone is epic in every way, with a striking new design, fastest Galaxy processor yet, a battery that goes all day and then some, and the first Galaxy ever supporting super smooth 120Hz screen refresh rate at WQHD+ resolution, it’s no surprise why Ultra easily lives up to its name. We know your life moves fast, and there’s a fine line between what makes a moment ordinary and what makes it extraordinary. That’s why Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G is purposefully crafted so you don’t need to choose between video and photo. With a single tap, you can pull super-clear stills — up to 33MP — straight from high-resolution 8K video. Use the 108MP high-resolution camera for still shots that come out crystal clear whether it’s day or night. Single Take AI transcends the usual restrictions of photo and video editing to capture life’s greatest moments, wherever they happen, in one single take, capturing images and video for up to 15 seconds. Experience the power of the Galaxy S21 5G series. Innovative and beautifully designed, Samsung 5G phones emphasize the brand’s dedication to the latest cutting-edge technology and next-generation connectivity. Enjoy more sharing, more streaming, more experiences, and more connections at lightning-fast speed. The Galaxy S21+ 5G does not currently support eSim in the U.S. Battery power consumption depends on usage patterns and results may vary. 5G speeds vary and require optimal network and connection (factors include frequency, bandwidth, congestion).",
